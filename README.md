ðŸŽ² Ludo Dice Game in Python
A simple, interactive 3-player dice game built with Python! Each player takes turns rolling a virtual dice, racing to reach exactly position 100. The game uses basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, user input, and the random module to simulate real-time gameplay.

ðŸ§© How it works:

All players start at position 0.

Each player rolls a dice (1â€“6) on their turn.

Players move forward by the dice number.

They must land exactly on 100 to win.

If the dice roll overshoots 100, the player stays in the same spot.

The first player to hit 100 wins the game! ðŸŽ‰

Perfect for beginners learning Python basics like dictionaries, loops, and functions.
